## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Startup**: Displays a welcome message.
2. **Login**: User enters a 4-digit password using the keypad.
3. **Correct Password**: Servo rotates to open position; green LED turns on; access time is logged.
4. **Wrong Password**: Red LED blinks, error tones played.
5. **3 Wrong Attempts**: System enters lockout for 30 seconds.
6. **In-Menu Options**:
   - Change password
   - Toggle auto-close
   - View access logs
   - See wrong attempts
   - Adjust brightness
   - Firmware info
   - How-to-use guide
## ðŸ§  EEPROM Usage

The password is stored in EEPROM, so it persists even after power loss. On reset, the system reads the saved password from EEPROM.
